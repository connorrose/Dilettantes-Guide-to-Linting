This guide is a ground-up look at how the most popular Javascript linting tools can be used together to professionalize any codebase. It covers integrating ESLint with Prettier, within VS Code, utilizing the AirBnB style guide, and assumes very basic familiarity with VS Code & the command line.

The explanations in [the main article](https://dev.to/connorrose/a-dilettante-s-guide-to-linting-3b02) are geared towards those who are new to web development and want a deeper understanding than just "_copy-paste these terminal commands_". For those who _do_ want a no-frills copypasta solution, there's a TLDR version as well.
